# Clocking-Out
Clocking Out is a First person shooter where a player's work place has been taken over by robots and you must take back your job by anymeans, or office supplies necessary. This project was created 15 weeks and I was onbaorded during week 7. I ended working a lot on the player movement to get it feeling right. I also crteated one of the weapons the pen sniper rifle. I also programmed the UI so it worked properly and allowed players to know what they needed to know. I also created and implemented all of the sfx for the game. You can play Clocking Out on Itch.io!
